              I'm currently on a 100 Days of Code journey, which I started on
              July 9, 2024 . Every day, I'm learning something new in both DSA
              and Development . If you'd like to follow my progress, feel free

              I created my first website during my first-ever hackathon, held at
              MSIT, Delhi , using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with my team. I
              had no idea about any of it at the time, but I managed to create a
              simple website. Unfortunately, we didn't win, but we learned a lot
              and really enjoyed meeting fellow tech nerds... haha!{" "}

              I started learning programming with Java in my first year, with no
              prior knowledge of programming at all. Java quickly became my
              first love :) Learning programming was so challenging for me that
              I switched teachers three times: Ranga, Tim, and finally Mosh .
              Mosh's Java course was exceptional and on point, ig thatâ€™s why
              he's the GOAT of tech community. I still use Java for DSA and plan
              to continue using it.
