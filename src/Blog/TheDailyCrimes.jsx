            I posted my recent project, 'The Daily Crimes,' on{" "}

            , and it somehow went viral. As of now, it has over 61K impressions,
            600+ likes. Obviously, I started getting tons of emails and messages
            on Twitter and LinkedIn, with many people asking for my help and
            wanting to create something similar. So, I thought, why not write a
            blog about it to help everyone and also kickstart my blogging
            journey. This is my first blog, so please don't judge me!

            I saw this paper portfolio by NiccolÃ² Miranda and completely fell in
            love with it â€” who wouldn't, right? So, I thought, why not make one
            for myself? But I already had a portfolio and wanted to create
            something unique. Then I came across the heartbreaking Kolkata rape
            case, and it inspired me to create a newspaper-style website focused
            on crimes in India, to address the issue while showcasing my
            front-end skills.

            but, what did I use in this project?
          </p>
          I didn't use anything special or out of the box. I just used React
          with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for the styles, and GSAP for the
          animations. And that's all you need to create a website like this.
